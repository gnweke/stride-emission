## 2025-08-13 — Initial Commit & Setup
- Completed development of the **stride-emission** Solana Anchor program.
- Implemented core functionality:

  - Stake and unstake device functions with PDA-based vault authority.
  - Reward claim mechanism with epoch-based restrictions.
  - Epoch tick updater for reward gating.
- Created supporting scripts for:
  - Program initialization (`init.ts`)
  - Emission state configuration (`configure.ts`)
  - Epoch ticking (`epoch_tick.ts`)
  - Staking & unstaking (`stake_init.ts`, `stake_with_transfer.ts`, `unstake.ts`)
  - Claiming rewards (`claim.ts`)
  - Reading program state & user info (`read_state.ts`, `read_user.ts`, `read_balances.ts`)
